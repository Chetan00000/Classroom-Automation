## 📌 Core Features

* **📱 Remote Control:** Seamlessly switch lights and fans ON/OFF directly from a custom-built mobile application.
* **🔐 Secure Login Authentication:** Ensures that only authorized users can access the control panel via a secure app login.
* **🔄 Real-time Sync:** Leverages **Firebase Realtime Database** for instantaneous updates between the mobile app and the NodeMCU hardware.
* **🤖 Smart Automation Mode:**
    * Controls appliances intelligently based on **room occupancy** detected by a PIR sensor.
    * Adjusts fan operation automatically according to the **ambient room temperature**.
* **💸 Significant Energy Savings:** Designed to achieve an estimated **25–30% reduction** in energy consumption by eliminating wastage.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system operates in a closed loop, ensuring seamless communication between the hardware, cloud, and the user app.

**User App** ⇄ **Firebase Realtime Database** ⇄ **NodeMCU** ⇄ **Classroom Appliances**

1.  **Sensor Data Collection:** The **PIR sensor** detects movement (occupancy) and the **DHT11 sensor** measures the current temperature.
2.  **Data Sync to Cloud:** The NodeMCU reads this sensor data and continuously updates it to the Firebase Realtime Database.
3.  **App Interaction:** The mobile app fetches real-time sensor data from Firebase and displays it. The user can use control switches in the app to send commands back to Firebase.
4.  **Hardware Control:** The NodeMCU listens for changes in the database. When a command is received (e.g., "Turn Light ON"), it triggers the corresponding relay module to control the appliance.
5.  **Automation Logic:**
    * If no occupancy is detected for a set period, the NodeMCU automatically turns OFF all lights and fans.
    * If the temperature rises above a predefined threshold, the fan is automatically switched ON.
